BUTTON CHOICES:
A line starting with "..." is a button choice, example lines:
	... take the offer.
	... ignore the old guy.

CHOICE RESULT:
Any following lines (multiple) after a button choice starting with ">>>", make the button have a result.
A line starting with ">>> event", results in opening another event popup file. Example lines:
	>>> event lost-kid-choice1
	>>> event drunk-guy-pt2
A line starting with ">>> item", results in granting some amount of items. Example lines:
	>>> item bread 10
	>>> item golden-amulet 1
A line starting with ">>> stat", results in editing a stat value of all units in the party. Example lines:
	>>> stat max-health +5
	>>> stat stamina -2
If none of the lines following a button choice start with ">>> event", the button closes the popup.

NOTES & COMMENTS:
Any line starting with any other non-letter/non-digit symbol (~`!@#$%^&*.,;:|/\) is ignored. Example lines:
	# this is a note
	! this is also a note
An exception to this is the double quote symbol ("), it is assumed to be part of the text.

TEXT:
Every other line is part of the text. Example lines:
	The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
	The lazy dog didn't notice at all.
	"Some quoted text."

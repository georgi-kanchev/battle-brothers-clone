While walking through the streets of a town, the party hears a commotion. Not too far from them, two men seem to be having a very heated argument. As they get closer, they start making out some sentences.

“... you clearly stole it!”

“I did no such thing, it’s been in my family since before yours even came to this village!”

“Nonsense! My great-grandmother shared it with me on her deathbed!”

Now that they’re close enough, the group can see that the two men are food vendors, fighting in the middle of the market. Each of them holds a large wheel of cheese.

“You hardly had any customers last year! You can’t tell me you just suddenly got lucky.”

“It was a tough couple of years because all of our cows were sick. Nothing to do with luck or skill. Or my recipe!”

“You mean MY recipe.”

Upon taking a closer look, it’s very clear that one of the wheels is a bit darker in color. In their travels, the party has consumed all kinds of cheese, and have developed a basic sense of taste. The vendors notice their interest and offer them a piece - so they can hopefully help settle this dispute.

The party discusses and comes to the conclusion that...

... The lighter cheese is clearly superior and creamier. 
((Get some cheese, very tasty.))

... The darker cheese’s taste is way deeper.
((Get a discount for the next vendor in town - his family has been here for a long time and works everywhere.))

... Both taste awful. 
((One party member gets hit by an egg, getting a temporary debuff))

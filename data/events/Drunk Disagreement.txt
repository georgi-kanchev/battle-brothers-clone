Another night at the tavern - this one is a bit fancier than usual. Live music, enough space for dancing, good ale. This town has a reputation for being somewhat posh.

Suddenly, two men approach the group. They are well dressed, but carelessly carrying their pints. They don’t speak loudly, but there seems to be a pinch of irritation in their words.

"Good evening, lads! You seem to be travellers, aye? Would you mind if these two old geezers picked your brain a bit?"

"I wouldn’t call it an argument, no, we’re too good friends for this. It’s more of a... Little disagreement over fundamentals."

"Yes, yes. So, you see, me and my friend meet here every other day, so we can have a drink and talk. Since we both work at different parts of town, we rarely arrive at the same time."

"But one always arrives within half an hour of the other."

"Except today I had an exceptionally good day at the market, so I got a bit carried away, and arrived a bit later. However, you see, after so many years of doing this, we had never agreed on a specific time for our meetings. They are just a matter of fact - they happen every other evening."

"Here’s where I disagree - you’ve always been on time before, so I have an expectation that you won’t be late."

"Kind strangers, can someone be late, if they’re not expected to arrive at a certain time?"

The group thinks about it and decides that...

... The man wasn’t late, as there was no specific arrangement.
((Discount from the food market.))

... The man was late, as his friend was expecting him.
((Discount from the blacksmith.))

... They have both had too much to drink and are overthinking it.
((The men laugh and buy the members a round of drinks, boosting their morale.))

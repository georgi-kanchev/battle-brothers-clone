While travelling on the road, the party sees a group of 5 people walking along it. Each of the strangers is wearing a long white robe, covered in red embroidery, resembling a bird in flight, except for the one in the middle. What he’s wearing can hardly be described as clothes - more like dark, dirty rags that are trying their best to stay on him. 

When their paths cross, the men in white stop to greet the party. 

"The Forgiving smiles upon you, travelers!"

The man in the middle mutters something, almost inaudible.

"Oh, pay him no mind. He’s a bit confused. He used to be an honorable member of our church, but something evil has a hold of his heart now. To protect others and himself, we’re bringing him to the closest chapel, so he may seek forgiveness."

"No... Please... No more."

From up close, it’s easier to tell that the rags aren’t just dirty - they’re bloody. The man seems in distress, while the rest of the holy men are extremely calm.

The group decides to...

... Just let them go.
((The priests say a blessing in your name, small buff))

... Ask to take the man instead.
((New recruit.))

... Attack them.
((Gain a holy item.))

While passing through a small village, the party is approached by 3 young men, dressed in white robes with a big yellow flower embroidery on their chests.

“Welcome to our little town, kind strangers. We notice you’re brave soldiers, men of the sword. Have you already sought the protection of our Valiant Lord?”

They humbly look at the church that’s nearby and offer the members a friendly smile.

“We would appreciate even the smallest donation. The glory of His Valiance stretches all across the land, so your contribution won’t be forgotten!”

The group decides to...

... thank the disciplers, but decline to contribute. 
((nothing happens)

... make a small donation. 
((receive a book that can be read at camp once a month or something for a small buff))

... make a bigger donation. 
((receive flower marks that, when worn on their clothes when passing through towns with a church of the Valiant, will allow them to spend the night for free. However, this may have effect on the way members of separate religious factions interact with the group))

... decline with aggression and offend the church. 
((passing through a town with a church of the Valiant may lead to negative interactions, such as sanctions or higher prices.))

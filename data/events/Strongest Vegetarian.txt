A local fistfighting tournament was the last thing anyone expected to do first thing in the morning, but sometimes life is unpredictable. After a night of merry drinking in the tavern, they made new friends that managed to convince a few members to join in and test their strength. 

The rest of the party were so excited, screaming motivational words and hyping up their friends. And with all this support... 

All of them lost. The winner - the tallest, widest, strongest person they’ve seen in a small village like this. No way, they thought, there must be something with the food he’s eating. How else could he be this huge?

So they decide to ask him. His name is Andre, and he’s kind enough to invite them to his home for a chat and some cold water.

The group instantly notices that his home is actually a quite big farm, with all sorts of animals - cows, sheep, goats and a lot of chickens running around. That must be it - he is probably eating a few animals a day, so he can grow bigger and bigger. 

One member finally asks the question on everyone’s mind, but Andre just laughs.

"Eat my friends? No way! I love them way too much. Actually, I've never eaten meat in my entire life. My family was too poor, but as I was growing up, I found out just thinking about all this murder makes me extremely sad. So I vowed to never kill anything that I can call a friend! These animals provide me with so much more than just some meat."

Is that all? The party decides to... 

... Ask him for a recipe that will make them just as strong.
((The best vegetarian meal will provide you with a buff.))

... Ask if they could have one of his animals, as a friend, of course.
((Receive 4 loving chickens.))

... Laugh in his face and call him a big softie that’s never had a nice juicy steak before.
((Cruelty is what makes a man weak, get a debuff.))

After winning a battle with some bandits, the only one still standing against the party is a young boy. He looks around nervously - all the blood and the bodies are scary, but he decides to instead grip his sword even stronger.

“I won’t surrender! I shall die with my brothers!

The group has already started looting the corpses and pays him no mind. 

H-hey! I’m talking to you. I’m still here, the fight hasn’t ended. Fight me now, cowards!

One member laughs, another tells the boy to piss off. A few minutes pass, and the adrenaline starts to wear off. The boy throws his sword and kneels, conceding to reality. 

So... Will you just leave me here What am I supposed to do

The boy looks strong, and is still young. He might have potential. The party decides to... 

... Let him join you.
((Get a new member.))

... Let him be.
((It is what it is.))

... Kill him, actually. 
((Get his sword. It’s almost not trash.))

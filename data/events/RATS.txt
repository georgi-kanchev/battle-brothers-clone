When the party first noticed the village, it looked quite ordinary - houses, fences, trees. But the closer they got, the clearer the reality became. The heavy silence hit them first. Then, they noticed the ruin - door left open, broken windows, a very particular malignant smell.

They stop walking and decide to check inside a house. Thankfully, there are no corpses inside. They notice that a lot of belongings were still left there - as if the people living there left in a hurry. 

The members split and check more houses - also empty. No trace of food, spoiled or otherwise, anywhere either. In the middle of the village is a large wooden storage building. Its door, still standing, is a bit difficult to open. In response to the noise it makes, a chain of squeaking begins. The sunlight reveals tens, hundreds, even thousands of little eyes staring back at the group. 

Then, the rattle of many tiny feet, moving in any possible direction. Rats.

With little time to make a proper decision, the party is forced to... 

... Kill as many of them as they can.
((Clearing out the storage, they can now get their hands on whatever the rats couldn’t eat - some equipment.))

... Set fire to the storage.
((Lots of dead rats, and lots of houses to loot. Find some generic clothes, cooking equipment, even alcohol.))


... Run away.
((The rats’ flawless victory has an effect on the group’s morale.))

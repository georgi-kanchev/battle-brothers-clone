While entering a big town, the group is stopped by a guard. He’s old and limps, his face looks a bit grumpy.

"Welcome to our town, men. Before you go further, I would like to ask you a few questions. You see, a lot of bandit activity around here, we need to be careful who we let roam inside the walls. I’m sure you understand."

After asking them some basic questions about them and their intentions, the guard’s mood seems to improve.

"Well how about that, you fellas seem like quite fine adventurers! You must be tired from your travels, how about I show you to the nearest tavern - my shift’s just ending. Bald Terry will take over for me, right Terry?"

He waves to the other guard and starts walking. The group follows. The older man continues talking to them.

"You know, I was just like you once. Young and mighty, full of ambition. I had my own gang of rascals, set on making a name for ourselves. But one day we were brutally ambushed, possibly even betrayed. Some of us escaped with our lives, and I even took an arrow to the knee. With our morale low and my health even worse, we went our separate ways."

He stops before a big wooden door and knocks on it rhythmically.

"Ay, Rosie, let me in. I’m bringing you paying customers!" He shouts, then turns to the group. "It’s a fancy place, invite only, but I’m sure we have much more to talk about, eh!"

The group decides to …

... Join the man, buy him a drink or two.
((He gets so into it, that he tells you about some weapons he buried closeby.))

... Join the man, but don’t treat him to anything.
((You get to hear even more stories about his past, which are quite motivating, get a buff.))

... Politely decline, you have better things to do in the afternoon than drinking.
((You break an old man’s heart. Live with it.))

... Tell the old fart you don’t give a damn about his stupid life.
((Through his connections, he makes sure everything in town becomes more expensive.))

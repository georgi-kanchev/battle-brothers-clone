Nearing the outskirts of a town, the party hears the soft ring of little bells. When they get closer, they see a woman, trying to get the attention of the passerbys. She is wearing a long green skirt, over which a red shorter one, and a yellow shirt. Her dark curly hair is following her every move, as she’s dancing to the sound of her little chimes.

As she notices the approaching members, she finishes her performance and strikes a conversation.

“Oh, what have the winds brought! Such strong and fearless warriors. But would you be brave enough to learn what Lady Fate has planned for you?”

She takes a seat at the little table behind her and starts shuffling her deck of cards.

"The first one is on me, boys!” She winks. “Now, pick a card..."

The fortune teller draws 3 cards and puts them face down. The party chooses...

... The one on the left. 
(("The Sun" - bonus gold in addition to the next reward they get.))

... The one in the middle. 
(("The Moon" - a random unit gets a buff during the next combat.))

... The one on the right. 
(("The Reaper" - a random unit gets a debuff during the next combat.))

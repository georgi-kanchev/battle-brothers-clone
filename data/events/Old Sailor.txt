It’s midday. The sun is high up in the sky, the weather is just the right amount of hot and a light breeze blows when the party crosses a bridge. Near the river, they see an old man, fishing patiently. A few extra fishing rods are being propped up by a curious stick structure.

His clothes are unusual, but more curiously - he’s wearing an eyepatch. This peaks the group’s interest, so they go to talk to him, as he’ll surely have a good story to tell.

"Me? A pirate? Nay, I am, or rather was, just a humble sailor. The sea is now but an old love of mine. A horrible, cruel mistress at times. But also generous and so beautiful, it was hard to let her go. But at my age, I would only get in the way of the younger folk. Ooop!"

One of the lines was being pulled. The old man grabbed it quickly and skillfully overpowered the fish that was unfortunate enough to fall for his bait.

"Mostly small fellas here, but it’s good enough for me. The sea, however, allows them to grow as big as they’re willing to get. Scary things I’ve seen out there..." 

He touches his eyepatch.

"On a stormy night, lost in the middle of nowhere. Half our crew was sick, the other - tired and wet to the bone, but still kicking. We thought it couldn’t get any worse - we shouldn’t have. It was almost as if our prayers for safety led it straight to us. The monster. By whose grace we survived, I cannot even remember. Such a memory is a dangerous place to visit."

The curious group decides to... 

... Ask for the name of the sea creature.
((Kraken? Maybe unlock it as a thing that can be encountered?))

... Offer to help him with the fishing.
((The group does so well, he gifts them his special rod.))

... Ask if they could buy some fish from him.
((Fresh fish for fresh coins.))

... Steal from him.
((Get his useless rod - it’s junk.))

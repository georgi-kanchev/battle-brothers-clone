The party is getting ready to leave a small village, when they see a few people passing them in a very serious rush. They’re heading to a barn with a large pen.

The closer they get, the louder the voices are and they notice a crowd forming. The members start to make out different words:

 bets!

"... for Red!"

"... 10 coins!"

"... on Yellow for sure!"

And then, they finally see what this is really about - the wooden pen has been separated in 4 long sections, forming a kind of a racing track. Inside, 4 pigs await the start of the challenge. Each of them has a colorful knitted scarf, and it seems people place bets by naming the color of their favorite.

"Alright, fellas, which pig do you fancy and how much are you willing to spare to support it?"

The pigs all look fat, healthy and somewhat happy. Some folk are touching them for luck.

The group decides to bet on the...

... Green pig.
((Second place. Receive back the money that was bet.))

... Red pig.
((Third place. The pig is just happy to be there, filling you with some joy and a small buff.))

... Yellow pig.
((Loser. Stink debuff.))

... Brown pig.
((First place. Win back twice the amount of the bet.))

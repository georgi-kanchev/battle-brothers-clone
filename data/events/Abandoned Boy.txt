The party’s travels lead them to a long road between two villages. Mostly emptiness along the trail, and a lot of trees surrounding it.

The members notice a tiny figure appear in the distance. It starts jumping, trying to get your attention. As you approach, you hear the squeaky voice of a boy.

"Kind sirs, please, you have to help me! My father got drunk in that village over there and left at noon without me! I've been walking all day long, I'll never make it home."

The boy's clothes seem of good quality and relatively clean. However, they are obviously too big for him. He rests his hands on his knees and takes a few deep breaths, before continuing.

"We live two villages over, my family and I. My dad came to trade, but I did all the working, while he was just having a good time with his friends. Please, my mum will be worried to death!"

The sun is setting over the horizon, painting the last golden moments of the day.

The group decides to...

... leave the boy on the road.
((this will upset some members of the party, giving them a negative effect or something idk))

... drop off the boy at the nearest village.
((the party will feel like they did a good thing, can give a positive effect))

... take the boy with them, so they can deliver him to his home.
((during the night, the boy will steal some money and an item maybe, and leave))

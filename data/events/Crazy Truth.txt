At sundown, along a rocky road, the group is travelling slowly, reminiscing of past adventures and planning their next objective. Suddenly, a loud scream breaks the cheerful atmosphere. Everyone stops. Some look around, others ready their weapons.

There’s still enough sunlight, so it’s easy to make out a single man running towards them from the surrounding forest. He glances back sporadically and continues to shout.

When he reaches the party, he stops. Before anyone else has the time to speak first, he breaks down crying.

"Thank you, kind warriors, for coming to my rescue. I thought my fate was sealed, that I was done for... But you arrived just in time! Going to that place alone was a mistake, I should’ve called for you earlier. Oh, the things I saw there."

He stops for a few moments, taking a few deep breaths.

"I saw the face of our God. Behind the glass. We are nothing but His playthings! Do you realize? This all, the world, the people, me, you - we are all little pawns. No more real than... No, that’s enough, I must save my breath. Come, now, lead me back home!"

The confused party decides to... 

... Follow his directions and escort him to his village.
((He awards you the gold he claims he owes you.))

... Continue down the road, leaving the lunatic alone.
((Debuff to something like an awareness stat?))

... Kill him, he knows too much.
((Buff to awareness?))
